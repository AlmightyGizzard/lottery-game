## A Simple Lottery game

This game presents the player with 6 balls, each with a random value between 1 and 59. 

The player can manually adjust up or down their chosen 6 balls until they are happy with their lucky numbers, after which 'start' can be selected. Alternatively, the player can select 'Lucky Numbers' to randomise their 6 balls. 

Once start is selected, the bowl of balls (or Tim) will spin, producing 6 balls at random. The player will then recieve an award of up to Â£500 if they match at least 3 of their balls.
